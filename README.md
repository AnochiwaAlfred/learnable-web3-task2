### 1. Explain Version Control:
Version control is a system that helps manage changes to a project's source code or files over time. It allows multiple contributors to work on the same project, keeping track of modifications, and providing the ability to revert to previous states if needed.

### 2. Expain the difference between Git and GitHub:
**Git:** It's a distributed version control system, a tool for tracking changes in source code during software development. It operates locally on your machine.  
**GitHub:** It's a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. GitHub provides additional features like collaboration tools, issue tracking, and hosting repositories online.

### 3. List 3 Other GitHub Alternatives:
- GitLab  
- Bitbucket  
- SourceForge

- **Git Fetch:** Fetches changes from a remote repository to your local repository but does not automatically merge them with your current work.
- **Git Pull:** Fetches changes and automatically merges them into your current branch.

### 5. Explain in simple terms Git Rebase and the command for it:
